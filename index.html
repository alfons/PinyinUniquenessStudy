            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Despite heavy homophony in monosyllables (only 53.1% unique in the top 800,
                falling to 13.2% in the top 3,000), Pinyin works with near-character-level precision for polysyllabic
                words. Two-syllable forms are 98.4% unique in the top 3,000 most frequent, and 95.6% unique within the
                top 10,000 most frequent words, which is already well beyond everyday usage. In practice, ambiguity is
                rare, context-resolvable, and largely limited to a small set of highly polysemous monosyllables.</p>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Even within a very small, high-frequency set, single-syllable Pinyin is weakly distinctive: only
                    <strong>53.1%</strong> of the top <strong>800</strong> monosyllables are unique, dropping to
                    <strong>13.2%</strong> in the top <strong>3,000</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>By contrast, <strong>two-syllable words</strong> show near-character-level precision in Pinyin:
                    <strong>98.4%</strong> uniqueness in the top <strong>3,000</strong> most frequent words.
                </li>
                <li>Across a broad, everyday-relevant vocabulary, Pinyin remains highly distinctive:
                    <strong>95.6%</strong> of the top <strong>10,000</strong> two-syllable words have unique spellings.
                </li>
                <li>Even with much larger lexical coverage, the majority of ambiguity remains limited:
                    <strong>90.8%</strong> of the top <strong>25,000</strong> two-syllable words are still uniquely
                    identifiable
                    by Pinyin alone.
                </li>
                <li>For longer words, distinctiveness is effectively complete: <strong>99.2%</strong> of
                    <strong>three-syllable</strong> words in the top <strong>10,000</strong> are uniquely spelled in
                    Pinyin.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>This means that for words with two or more syllables, Pinyin is nearly as unambiguous as writing with Chinese
                characters themselves. The small number of ambiguous cases are usually resolved effortlessly from
                context.</p>
            <p>Therefore, homophony mainly affects extremely versatile monosyllabic words such as <em>shì</em>,
                <em>jí</em>, or <em>yì</em>; but even these are, in practice, easy to interpret from context.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                <em>Jenny shì Zhōngwén lǎoshī. Wǒ gēn tā xuéxí de shíhou, tā gěi wǒ de nà běn shū duì wǒ jí
                    zhòngyào.</em><br>
                (Jenny is a Chinese teacher. When I was studying with her, the book she gave me was extremely important
                to me.) No Chinese speaker would have any difficulty interpreting shì in “Jenny shì Zhōngwén lǎoshī” as
                the verb “to be,” rather than confusing it with other meanings such as “matter”, “room”, “city”, or “to
                try”.
            </p>

            <p>However, it is crucial that Pinyin spelling be accurate (following the rules of <strong>GB/T
                    16159-2012</strong>, the national standard of the People's Republic of China for Chinese phonetic
                alphabet orthography) and not distorted by tone sandhi or spelling mistakes.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                <em>Yàoshi bìngqíng yì zhì jiù hǎo le.</em><br>
                (If the illness were easy to treat, that would be good.)<br>
                Here, <em>yì</em> means “easy” and <em>zhì</em> means “to treat.” If these were written together, as a
                single word, or if the tone on yì were changed, the meaning would change or become difficult to
                interpret.
            </p>
