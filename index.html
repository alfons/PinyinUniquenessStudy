            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Single-syllable Pinyin spellings are highly homophonous, while compound
                words written in standardized Pinyin (spaces and hyphens removed) are almost as unique as the Chinese
                characters themselves.</p>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Among the <strong>3,000 most frequent single characters</strong>, <strong>22.0%</strong> have a
                    unique spelling in Pinyin.</li>
                <li>Among <strong>all 4,681 single-character words</strong> in the dictionary, only
                    <strong>12.9%</strong> have unique Pinyin spelling.
                </li>
                <li>In contrast, the <strong>3,000 most frequent two-character words</strong> achieve an astonishing
                    <strong>98.5%</strong> uniqueness in Pinyin spelling.
                </li>
                <li>Even when expanding to <strong>all ~29,000 two-character words</strong> in the dictionary,
                    <strong>90.1%</strong> still have unique Pinyin spelling.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>This means that for words with two or more syllables, Pinyin is nearly as precise as writing with Chinese
                characters themselves. The small number of ambiguous cases are usually resolved effortlessly from
                context.</p>
            <p>Therefore, homophony mainly affects extremely versatile monosyllabic words such as <em>shì</em>,
                <em>jí</em>, or <em>yì</em>; but even these are, in practice, easy to interpret from context.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                <em>Jenny shì Zhōngwén lǎoshī. Wǒ gēn tā xuéxí de shíhou, tā gěi wǒ de nà běn shū duì wǒ jí
                    zhòngyào.</em><br>
                (Jenny is a Chinese teacher. When I was studying with her, the book she gave me was extremely important
                to me.) No Chinese speaker would have any difficulty interpreting shì in “Jenny shì Zhōngwén lǎoshī” as
                the verb “to be,” rather than confusing it with other meanings such as “matter”, “room”, “city”, or “to
                try”.
            </p>

            <p>However, it is crucial that Pinyin spelling be accurate (following the rules of <strong>GB/T
                    16159-2012</strong>, the national standard of the People's Republic of China for Chinese phonetic
                alphabet orthography) and not distorted by tone sandhi or spelling mistakes.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                <em>Yàoshi bìngqíng yì zhì jiù hǎo le.</em><br>
                (If the illness were easy to treat, that would be good.)<br>
                Here, <em>yì</em> means “easy” and <em>zhì</em> means “to treat.”
            </p>
