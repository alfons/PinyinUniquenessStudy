## Discussion

This means that for words with two or more syllables, Pinyin is nearly as precise as writing with Chinese characters themselves. The small number of ambiguous cases are usually resolved effortlessly from context.

Therefore, homophony (same spelling, different meanings) mainly affects extremely versatile monosyllabic words such as *shì*, *jí*, or *yì*; but even these are, in practice, easy to interpret from context.

**Example:**  
*Jenny shì Zhōngwén lǎoshī. Wǒ gēn tā xuéxí de shíhou, tā gěi wǒ de nà běn shū duì wǒ jí zhòngyào.*  
(Jenny is a Chinese teacher. When I was studying with her, the book she gave me was extremely important to me.)
No Chinese speaker would have any difficulty interpreting shì in “Jenny shì Zhōngwén lǎoshī” as the verb “to be,” rather than confusing it with other meanings such as “matter”, “room”, “city”, or “to try”.

However, it is crucial that Pinyin spelling be accurate (following the rules of **GB/T 16159-2012**, the national standard of the People's Republic of China for Chinese phonetic alphabet orthography) and not distorted by tone sandhi or spelling mistakes.

**Example:**  
*Yàoshi bìngqíng yì zhì jiù hǎo le.*  
(If the illness were easy to treat, that would be good.)  

Here, *yì* means “easy” and *zhì* means “to treat.” If these were written together as a single word, or if the tone on *yì* were changed, the meaning would change or become difficult to interpret.
